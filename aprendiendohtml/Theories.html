            <p> Raiders of the Lost Ark is almost perfect. But the fact that Indy accomplishes nothing in the movie (that is, if he was never involved at all, the story would have the same exact climactic moment - the Nazis would open pandora's box and melt) stops it from being perfect.</p>

            <p>Back to the Future SEEMINGLY could be imperfect (why don't Mom and Dad remember Marty?), but I would still argue it's a perfect film because there are reasons why this could conceivably be the case (time protects itself from unraveling, etc). Or maybe I'm in denial. Who knows.</p>
